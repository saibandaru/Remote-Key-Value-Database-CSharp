Project 4
=========
Remote Key/Value Database

Demonstration:
=============
Open Adminstrator Command line and run all the run.bat files.

run_R2W2+WPF.bat here we are starting server, starter process that starts read/write clients and WPF Client
run_R2W2.bat here we are starting server, starter process that starts read/write clients(2 read and 2 write clients, here we also have performance UI to check for performance
run_R4W4.bat here we are starting server, starter process that starts read/write clients(4 read and 4 write clients, here we also have performance UI to check for performance
run_req2.bat here we demonstrate all the requirements that are performed in Project 2 using remote console client

Note: please close all the client and server before running new run.bat as the receiver cannot start if there is already a listner
Assumption:
==========

The latency and throughput is the average of all the test clients(read and write clients)
